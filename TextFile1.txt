I have created a Entity class called Disease;

I have created a repository class called DiseasesManager to add the Disease,add the Symptoms to the Disease and to chech the patient
In this DiseasesManager i have created thre function
addDisease() --> to add the Disease
addSymptons()--> to add the Symptoms to the Disease avaialble
it throws error if disease is not available in the database
checkPatient() --> to diagnose the disease.

I have created the UI design Class called DiseaseUI to display the menu
in that class i have created three helper functions to add the disease,to add symptoms and to check the patient
